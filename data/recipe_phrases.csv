filet mignon,0
we rarely eat beef but when we do for special occasions we enjoy the above for a most tender cut of beef.,0
here is the way our family does it. there are other  methods of seasoning and roasting but we are always satisfied with the results  this way.,0
"try to buy a whole fillet that is already ""peeled "" ( trimmed of  silverskin, fat etc. ) or if you prefer you can buy untrimmed and do it  yourself.",0
"the whole filet has a taped part ( called the tail ) and when you  roast, tuck this part under so you can have a more even  piece of meat for  roasting.",0
if the whole filet is too large to fit your roasting pan you may cut  the filet in half and roast the two parts in the pan together.,0
make sure the  meat comes to room temperature prior to roasting for even roasting which also  helps with tenderness.,0
"rub oil ( we prefer olive ) over the filet and then rub in seasonings such as salt , pepper, paprika, crushed garlic etc. the montreal  steak seasoning is a nice choice ( available in the seasoning or meat sections  of supermarkets ) .",0
or other people prefer to coat the filet with dijon mustard  and then roll the filet in  finely crushed black or colored peppercorns prior to roasting.,0
both ways are delicious.,0
place the filet on a  roasting rack over the  roasting pan.,0
you can also place the filet over some beef bones in the pan which also act as a rack.,0
preheat the oven to 475 degrees f.,0
place the prepared filet on the rack and  roast 20 minutes ( for a average 5 lb roast- ). then decrease the temperature to 350f and roast an additional 20 minutes.,0
remove the filet from the oven and let  sit about 15 minutes before slicing.,0
this total time factor  should produce  medium rare.  a heavier roast will probably need more roasting time and a  smaller roast less time. the sitting times allows for best slicing and lets some of the juices settle etc.    if you prefer you can  check and rely on a meat  thermometer to test so you don't under or over roast the meat..,0
"insert  thermometer in the thickest part of the roast. generally 120 to 130 f is rare  and 130 to 140 f is medium rare. remember the meat will continue to cook with  ""standing time"" out of the oven.",0
meanwhile make the mushroom sauce ( this is a natural and not thickened sauce ). in a large skillet over medium high heat cook the onion in some olive oil or butter until softened.,0
add the sliced mushrooms  and garlic and continue to cook and stir until the mushrooms have reduced in  volume by 1/2 and become tender.,0
"add the vermouth, dashes of worcestershire  sauce and gravy master (  a browning/ caramelized color for sauces etc. ). cook  and stir  another 5 to 10 minutes and then season to taste.   if you wish you   may add a few tablespoons of the pan drippings or a bit of beef bullion paste (  available in jars ) for a richer flavor.",0
the whole recipe really can serve  quite a lot depending on how thick or thin you slice the meat. leftovers reheat  well.,0

notes :,0
"use a double boiler to scald the cream unless you have a heavy  saucepan.   use very low heat.  milk scorches easily and, when scorched, should  be thrown out.",0
beat eggs or egg yolks with a wire whisk or beater.   add sugar gradually and continue whipping until it is thoroughly mixed inches.,0
"never add eggs directly to a hot mixture. (unless you like scrambled eggs in cream.)  pour some of the hot liquid into the eggs while stirring briskly, then  return the warmed combination to the remaining hot liquid in the pan.",0
"stir the custard constantly over low heat until it acquires body.   test it  by letting it run off the back of a spoon; if a light coating clings to the  spoon, the custard is finished.",0
"stir the custard occasionally as it cools to prevent a surface skin from  forming.   when it is cool, chill it, covered lightly with a clean dish towel, in the refrigerator.",0
